%psk8Modulator 8-PSK modulator with pulse shaping
%   Y = psk8Modulator(X,SPS) 8-PSK modulates the input X, and returns the
%   root-raised cosine pulse shaped signal Y. X must be a column vector
%   of values in the set [0 7]. The root-raised cosine filter has a
%   roll-off factor of 0.35 and spans four symbols. The output signal
%   Y has unit power.
